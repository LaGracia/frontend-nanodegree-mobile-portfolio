## Description

Project 4 involved optimizing a hypothetical portfolio for speed. There were two parts to the project: first, optimize the critical rendering path of the main index page; second, rewrite some JavaScript so that the pizzeria page will render as quickly as possible. These modifications are aimed at improving user experience on the site.

### Features

To achieve PageSpeed Insights scores above 90:
- Optimized images (compressed and resized for their respective pages)
- Inlined CSS and minified JSS
- Async JavaScript requests 
To achieve 60 frames per second on page scroll:
- Optimized JavaScript (using getElementsByClassName instead of querySelectorAll)

### Credits

As always, I completed this project mainly by learning from others the discussion forum. So, many thanks to everyone who posted questions and answered them there!

### License

I do not own the portfolio created by Cameron Pittman, but my optimization work on it is licensed under [GitHubâ€™s terms of service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/), meaning you can view and fork this repository.
