## Description

Project 4 of the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree was website optimization. In addition, we used build tools to automate the tasks involved, such as image compression. This process results in two versions of each file. The development folder contains the version for the web developer, and the production folder contains the optimized version used for the actual site.

I used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate the optimization of CSS, JS and PNG files needed for the site. (I ran into errors installing every Grunt plugin available for optimizing JPEGs, so that was done manually.)

To build the site using files in the development folder:
- Install [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install the Grunt [plugins](http://gruntjs.com/plugins) listed in Gruntfile.js
- Enter "grunt" in the Terminal to generate the optimized production files

### Credits

As always, I completed this project mainly by learning from others the discussion forum, so thanks to all who posted questions and answered them there. Thanks in particular to andrew_R and Susan for their instructions on how to work with development and production files.
